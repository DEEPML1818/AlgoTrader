# Project-wide TODOs for Robustness, Security, and Maintainability

## Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] Ensure all error handling uses the centralized Logger utility
- [ ] Add contextual information to all error logs
- [ ] Refactor catch blocks to avoid silent re-throws and provide actionable error messages

## Security Concerns
- [ ] Harden plugin sandbox (done)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to all API endpoints
- [ ] Add robust input validation to all API endpoints
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data (API keys, secrets) at rest and in transit

## Type Safety
- [ ] Replace all `any` usages with explicit types or generics
- [ ] Ensure all interfaces are fully defined and TypeScript strict mode is respected

## Resource Management
- [ ] Ensure all plugins are properly disposed in MLPluginManager
- [ ] Add cleanup for all WebSocket connections
- [ ] Add resource limits to plugin execution
- [ ] Improve local storage quota management

## Testing Coverage
- [ ] Add integration tests for trading flow
- [ ] Add error scenario tests for backtester
- [ ] Add performance tests for real-time data

## State Management
- [ ] Audit for race conditions in portfolio management
- [ ] Add optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- [ ] Ensure consistent state synchronization between components

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add pagination to plugin marketplace listings
- [ ] Move heavy computations off the main thread
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize WebSocket connection management

## Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add detailed performance metrics
- [ ] Add transaction tracing across components
- [ ] Add error tracking and alerting system
- [ ] Establish performance baselines

## Code Organization
- [ ] Refactor large components to single responsibility
- [ ] Remove duplicate code in error handling and API response formatting
- [ ] Standardize file structure across features
- [ ] Add documentation for key algorithms

## Dependency Management
- [ ] Update all outdated dependencies
- [ ] Ensure lock file is committed
- [ ] Establish strategy for ML model/plugin dependencies
- [ ] Prevent dependency conflicts in plugins

## Blockchain Integration
- [ ] Add error handling for blockchain transactions
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for blockchain service failures
- [ ] Validate all smart contract interactions
- [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed transactions

## Risk Management
- [ ] Add validation for risk limit updates
- [ ] Complete portfolio risk calculations
- [ ] Add real-time risk alerts system
- [ ] Add stress testing capabilities
